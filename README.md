# BluetoothUnreal

In JarTuto_APL.xml I wrote my Java Android code to connect bluetooth with a default device and send data to Unreal Engine through JNI.
In JarTutoCharacter.cpp in method initEnvironment I run the Java functions wrote in JarTuto_APL.xml. In tick method I gather informations send via bluetooth.
